### Parsing this file
#####################

# Start the line with # to make a comment
# You can leave blank lines, if you so desire.

# Currently, the parser is pretty simple, It only greps for a # char in the line
So, because it has a # char, this entire line is a comment.

# Any line that is not empty, (or doesnt contain #,) is treated as part of the watch list.
# For this reason you should trim trailing spaces before saving


###########################
### WatchList record fields
###########################

# The WatchList record fields are seperated by colons, (:), ie "WatchLevel:PathToDirOrFile:Excludes", (or Includes)
# Note1: You can either have an "--include(..)" or an "--exclude(..)", you cant have both on the same "inotifywatch".
# Note2: The case insensitive versions "excludei(..)" and "includei(..)" are not yet supported.
# Note3: I should point out that although the "--include(..)" doesn't produce errors, in operation it is buggy. For some
# reason it tries to watch extreaneous files and folders not actually included in the list.

# The record must have a WatchLevel and Path to the watched directory, (or file,) seperated by a colon. Excludes and
# Includes, also seperated from the path by a colon, are optional. They are of the format "--exclude(..)" or
# "--include(..)" where the braces, (..), contain regular expressions seperated by pipes, '|'.

# By the way, there is no need to panic at the mention of regex, as you will see below, in most use cases, the regex is
# very, very basic and consists solely of terminating the "/PathToTargetDir/" with the wildcard '.*'

# The reason for the wild card is because the "--exclude()"/"--include()" options only apply to files. Hence, a wild card
# is needed so that it has something to search for when indexing all the files and subfolders etc

# While those skilled in the use of RegEx may construct elaborate "--include()"/"--exclude()" expressions, us lesser
# mortals just need to remmember not to use the '\' Esc char, (not the same as '/'), unless we mean it. (To reiterate, in
# most practical situations, we only need '.*' wildcard)

# Finally, "DeskTop Devil" automaticaly sets the "-mr" option. Ie "-r" means watches are recursive, and the -m option
# means watches continue untill killed by the main panel. (Note: new files and sub folders are automatically added to the
# WatchList.)


#############################
### Possible WatchLevels: ###
#############################

# (This is an early alpha, so these may be subject to some slight modifications)
# CRITICAL: access, open, close, create, delete, modify, move
#     HIGH: open, close, create, delete, modify, move
# ELAVATED: access, create, delete, modify, move
#  "MEDIUM: create, delete, modify, move
#  "CUSTOM: -e event1 -e event2..........(Not yet supported) see "inotifywait --help" or "inotifywait manual" for details

### ### ### Example WatchList ### ### ###
#########################################

# This example is based on Arch file system architecture, other distros may require aditional root paths. For example,
# in Arch, /bin/ and /sbin/ are symlinked to /usr/bin/. Additionally, /lib/ is symlinked to /usr/lib/

# The basic steps to configuring the WatchList are:
# 1) -- Set up a basic configuration.
# 2) -- Run it.
# 3) -- Refine the excludes and WatchLevels.
# 4) -- Run it.
# 5) -- Refine it again.
# 6) -- Run it .... Refine it. ....
# 7) -- Untill you are not annoyed by irrelavent notifications.

# This doesn't take long, annoyances become apparent almost immediately. I set up the basic configuration below, in about
# 5 minutes. It was just a case of adding excludes as unforseen annoyances appeared.

# In the example below, note the colon seperating the "path" from the "--exclude(..)" and also note there are NO Spaces

# Also:
# "--exclude=(lib/apparmor/.*|lib/modules/.*)" translates as: WATCH everything but "lib/apparmor" and "lib/modules"
# "--include=(lib/apparmor/.*|lib/modules/.*)" translates as: EXCLUDE everything but "lib/apparmor" and "lib/modules"
# Remember "--include=(..)" is buggy, (I am beginning to suspect that the problems originate in "inotify-tools")

# Finally, this is an example of how to configure, not an actual configuration.
